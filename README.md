# CMSC423: Fall 2025 Project 2 sample data

The file names encode the parameters used.  Specifically, to generate `reads_100_5_0.30.fa` (and the corresponding `.stats`), the simulator was run on `genome.fa` with read length 100, expected coverage 5, 
and $\theta = 0.3$.  

To generate `reads_200_40_0.20.fa` (and the corresponding `.stats`), the simulator was run on `genome_small.fa` with read length 200, expected coverage 40, 
and $\theta = 0.2$.
